<h4 id="about">About</h4>
<p>
Agrippa is a PHP-based secret sharing mechanism. Named after the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrippa_(A_Book_of_the_Dead)">William Gibson</a>, Agrippa operates on the principle that sharing a temporary link to sensitive information is better than having the sensitive information itself persist in email, chat, or any other insecure communications channel.
</p>

<h4 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h4>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>Enter the secret to share, an expiration date/time, and a view limit.</li>
    <li>Receive a unique link to the secret, which can be shared with the intended recipient.</li>
    <li>Once the link expires or the view limit is surpassed, the secret is destroyed.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h4 id="requirements">Requirements</h4>
<p>
  In short, Agrippa has the same requirements as <a href="http://laravel.com/docs/5.1#installation">Laravel 5.1</a>:
  <ul>
    <li>Apache or Nginx</li>
    <li>PHP >= 5.5.9</li>
    <li>Composer</li>
    <li>OpenSSL PHP Extension</li>
    <li>PDO PHP Extension</li>
    <li>Mbstring PHP Extension</li>
    <li>Tokenizer PHP Extension</li>
  </ul>
</p>

Documentation for the framework (Laravel 5.1) can be found on the <a href="http://laravel.com/docs/5.1">Laravel website</a>. To get a development environment up and running, see the <a href="http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/homestead">Laravel Homestead documentation</a>. You can reference the following example Homestead configuration, if it helps:

<h4 id="history">History</h4>
<p>
The idea of sharing secrets through URLs with time and view limits originally came from <a href="https://github.com/pglombardo">pglombardo</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher">PasswordPusher</a>, written with Ruby on Rails in 2011. In 2012, the project was shared on Reddit and subsequently open-sourced, leading to <a href="https://github.com/bemosior/PHPasswordPusher">PHPasswordPusher</a>, a PHP port of the original. Agrippa is itself a rewrite that sports the flexibility of the Laravel framework, while PHPasswordPusher provides the basic functionality for those constrained to older PHP versions (5.3+). As of August 2015, all projects continue to be actively maintained.
