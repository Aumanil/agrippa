## Agrippa

Agrippa is a PHP-based secret sharing mechanism. Named after the work of [William Gibson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrippa_(A_Book_of_the_Dead)), Agrippa operates on the principle that sharing a temporary link to sensitive information is better than having the sensitive information itself persist in email, chat, or any other insecure communications channel.
